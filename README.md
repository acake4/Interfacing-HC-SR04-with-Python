# Interfacing-HC-SR04-with-Python
Interfacing Ultrasound sensor HC-SR04 from terminal with python.

This example is made as an attepmt to get familiar with pyserial Python module.
For this example, I'm using Arduino Mega 2560 and Ultrasound Sensor HC-SR04. Connection is established through serial port COMx.

Arduino connections(HC-SR04 -> Arduino):
VCC -> 5V
GND -> GND
TRIG -> PWM2
ECHO -> PWM3
